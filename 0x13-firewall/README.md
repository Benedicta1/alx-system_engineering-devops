0x13. Firewall

In computing, a firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls 
incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. 
A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network, 
such as the Internet.

The term firewall originally referred to a wall intended to confine a fire within a line of adjacent buildings.
Later uses refer to similar structures, such as the metal sheet separating the engine compartment of a vehicle or aircraft 
from the passenger compartment. The term was applied in the late 1980s to network technologythat emerged when the Internet 
was fairly new in terms of its global use and connectivity.
The predecessors to firewalls for network security were routers used in the late 1980s. 
Because they already segregated networks, routers could apply filtering to packets crossing them.

Before it was used in real-life computing, the term appeared in the 1983 computer-hacking movie WarGames, and possibly inspired its later use.

Firewalls are categorized as a network-based or a host-based system. 
Network-based firewalls are positioned between two or more networks, typically between the local area network (LAN) and wide area network (WAN),theirbasic function is to control the flow of data between connected networks.
